This repo contains a base for running code on a chipkit that I then made the pong game upon. 

Compilation is through the mcb32tools environment, 
just be in the directory of the code with the terminal
then run . /opt/mcb32tools/environment
then make
and then make install
The code should then be written to the chipKit and run
